## Description
Repository of the project developed for the "Prova finale di Algoritmi e Strutture Dati" (Final test of Algorithms and Data Structures) course, part of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano.

This final test aims at assessing the students' ability to design and implement an efficient algorithm making use of the data structures learned during the course, all done using C as programming language.

This repository refers to the 2017 edition of the course, whose main topic is an in-memory Unix filesystem. The most important constraint for the project is that the time complexity of all the commands has to be at most O(l), with l being the length of the path. 

Inputs are given through the command line, and consist of:  
- Creating an empty file in an existing directory  
- Creating an empty directory  
- Reading the content of a file in a given path  
- Overwriting the content of a file in a given path  
- Deleting an existing resource in the filesystem  
- Deleting a resource and all of its children nodes  
- Fiding the path of all the resources whose name is provided as input
